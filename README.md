# Covid-19-Dashboard-Analysis
I successfully designed a Covid-19 Dashboard Analysis for India using Jupyter Notebook and Tableau. With Jupyter Notebook, I organized and analyzed pandemic data, exploring infection rates, recoveries, and regional disparities. Then, using Tableau's visual prowess, I transformed these insights into intuitive dashboards. Through interactive charts and maps, the project offers a user-friendly way to comprehend the pandemic's impact in India. This collaborative effort of Jupyter Notebook and Tableau resulted in an insightful and professionally presented Covid-19 analysis tool.
